# Design

1. Thinking about design methods allowed the finance bot made it easy for our team to develop and understand the needed functions and constraints needed to realistically finish the project during our sprints. Researching architecture styles allowed us to focus on using tools and relevant technology that would be most appropriate when implementing the design of our bot.

2. The most difficult aspect of our design was looking into aspects of security to ensure that people financial information was secure. We also hesistated when researching certain software to aid as third parties for our code. I would have focused more one existing software solutions that everyone in the group is most comfortable with rather than using technology that is newer unless the benefits of using the unfamiliar technology outweighs the negatives.

3. I would like to design architecture diagrams of our software as well as utilize UML when working with object-oriented programming in particular. 

# Implementation

1.  Using third party software such as Google's firebase while also utilizing npm modules such as react-bootstrap and react-hook-form make integration of the bot with the website very easy and less time-consuming.

2. The most difficult aspect of implementation of our design was documentation/self-documentation as many failures during running the finance-bot came from not having readable code or not following documentation closely when using firebase or one of the npm modules. I would read the entire documentation and communicate with team members so that they are consistent with the documentation. I would also recommend tips for programming when it comes to readability.

3. I will definetly try using react-bootstrap and react-hook-form together in the future to make styling much easier and less time-consuming when using React.

# Process

1. The most helpful thin about kanban was that the project board allowed developers to know who was doing what and when they completed a specific task. The kanban board on github made time management and delegation of task more fair and easy. Code review was helpful in allow each developer in the team to give feedback on push while controlling the flow of commits.

2. The most difficult aspect of the code process was making sure that people would be consitent in using the kanban board. Sometimes, we would just give tasks to people with out suing the kanban board. I would better utilize the kanban board so that issues could be submit more frequently for smallers tasks.

3. I would definetly use the knban board again when working with teams on a project since it made delegating tasks so efficient.

# Overall

1. The agile methodology of programming that we used was more efficient than the waterfall approach of programming that I'm used to. Because the developers of our team varied in programming experience, agile allowed developers to try out new ideas but go at a pace that is comfortable while not dragging the rest of the team down. I found implementation to mostly the same from past experience working with NodeJs in the past. Though using react and firebase made working with node a little different as I didn't have to deal with creating a REST API using express. Most of the react app was made using a single page application approach. As for software process, I have never used a kanban board or done a code review so this was an entirely new experience for me.
